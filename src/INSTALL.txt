Add the folder to the path and it shall be able to run.

The following is the guide:
- lodes.m: main program
- lodestest.m: provides a testing interface to LODES. Has the plotting and error calculation functions
- testing/testClases.m: lists the test cases for LODES
- testing/testscript.m: this is the main testscript for LODES which was used in developing the Test Report
