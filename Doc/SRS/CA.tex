\section{Introduction}

%\wss{This CA template is based on \citet{Smith2006}.

In physical sciences, mathematical models are derived from scientific models to
represent a real world phenomenon through formal mathematical constructs.

Scientific models in the study of radioactivity, carbon decay, and Newton's Law of Cooling
involve the use of ordinary differential equations (ODEs).

Known elementary techniques of solving ODEs in the discrete domain use the linear approximation
method wherein the solution is based upon assuming or ``approximating" the slope of the tangent
line from one reference point to the next until the target point has been reached.

The following section provides an overview of the Commonality Analysis (CA) for a
program family of ODE solvers for Initial Value Problems (IVP). The developed program will be
called \famdesc{} (\famname{}). This section explains the purpose of this
document, the scope of the family, the characteristics of the intended readers,
and the organization of the document.

\subsection{Purpose of Document}
The main purpose of this document is to formally describe program families of
the known well-known methods of solving Initial Value Problems of ODEs.
The goals and mathematical models used in the \famname{} code are provided with
an emphasis on explicitly identifying assumptions, constraints, and unambiguous definitions.

This document contains the description of the functionalities of the \famname{} software
library. This document is the starting point for the subsequent software development
activities, including writing the requirements specification, design specification, code,
software verification, validation plan, and execution.

\subsection{Scope of the Family}
The scope of the family is limited to the library of IVP ODE solvers. Given
the appropriate inputs, each program in \famname{} is intended to find the solution to an
Initial Value ODE problem.

\subsection{Characteristics of Intended Reader}
Reviewers of this document should have an elementary understanding of ordinary differential
equations and numerical methods, as typically covered in first and second year Calculus courses.
The users of \famname{} can have a lower level expertise, as explained in
Section~\ref{SecUserCharacteristics}.

\wss{For the characteristics of intended reader try to be more specific about
  the education.  What degree?  What course areas?  What level?}

\subsection{Organization of Document}
The organization of this document follows the template for a CA for scientific
computing software proposed by~\cite{Smith2006}. The presentation follows the standard
pattern of presenting goals, theories, definitions, and assumptions.
For a bottom-up approach, readers can begin reviewing the instance models in
Section \ref{sec_instance} and trace back to review additional information required.
The instance models provide the methods to solve Initial Value Problems (IVP)
of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs).

\section{General System Description}

This section identifies the interfaces between the system and its environment,
describes the potential user characteristics and lists the potential system
constraints.

\subsection{Potential System Contexts}

Figure~\ref{Fig_SystemContext} shows the system context.  A circle represents an
external entity outside the software, the driver program in this case. The driver program
shall use \famname{} in solving the ODE Initial Value Problems (IVPs).
A rectangle represents the software system itself (\famname{}). 
Arrows are used to show the data flow between the system and its environment.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
 \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth, height=0.20\textheight]{SystemContextFigure}
\caption{System Context}
\label{Fig_SystemContext} 
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Programs in \famname{} are used inside a driver program.  The external interaction is through
program calls. The solution to the ODE IVP is the output of the function. 
The responsibilities of the user and the system are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item User Responsibilities:
\begin{itemize}
\item Provide the correct program call, while adhering to conventions of the program's prototype
\item Provide the input details of the ODE to be solved, ensuring no errors in data entry
\item Declaration of the ODE method to be used in solving the ODE
\item Provide a valid ODE function which assumes a first order continuous ODE
\end{itemize}
\item \famname{} Responsibilities:
\begin{itemize}
\item Detect an improper input, such as invalid characters in the ODE statement and incomplete input arguments
\item Parse the input ODE string into a meaningful ODE equation that can be manipulated by the machine
\item Detect a data type mismatch where applicable, such as a string of characters in a floating point argument
\item Calculate the solution to the ODE problem
\item Provide the user access to the outputs of the program
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Potential User Characteristics} \label{SecUserCharacteristics}

The end user of \famname{} should have at least some basic programming experience and
an understanding of undergraduate Level 1 Calculus.

\subsection{Potential System Constraints}

There are no system constraints applicable.

\section{Commonalities}
This section primarily presents the background and motivation of the program family, which gives a
high-level view of the problem to be solved.  This is followed by the terminologies used, data
definitions, goals of the software, and the theoretical models used. 
% solution characteristics
% specification, which presents the theories, definitions, assumptions, and finally
% the instance models as variabilities.

\subsection{Background Overview} \label{Sec_Background}
\famname{} is a software library developed to be provide a means to solve Initial Value
Problems for ODEs using numerical methods. It can be used to solve different variations of ODEs
given their initial values. It can be implemented to find the most accurate method (the method
which produces the least error in their scientific computing implementation).

\subsection{Terminology and  Definitions}

This subsection provides a list of terms that are used in the subsequent
sections and their meanings, with the purpose of reducing ambiguity and making it
easier to correctly understand the requirements:

\begin{itemize}

\item Initial values: ``starting point" ($x_\text{0}, y_\text{0}$) of known values that
exists in the domain of the solution

\item Final values: An ``ending point" ($x_\text{k}, y_\text{k}$) of unknown value $y_\text{k}$
that exists in the domain of the solution

\item Step size: The measure of arbitrary positive value ($h$) from the starting point
($x_\text{0}, y_\text{0}$) of the domain to the next ($x_\text{1}, y_\text{1}$), where
$x_\text{1} = x_\text{0} + h$ \wss{It appears that you have the same step size
  throughout your computation.  You should add this fact as an assumption.
  Also, when you are presenting the step size, it would be better to use a
  generic step, rather than the first step.  It is a more general way to convey
  the information.}

\item Derivative: The amount by which a a function changes at any given point as an
instantaneous rate of change \wss{missing a period.}

\item Numerical Analysis: A branch of mathematics and computer science wherein the solutions
are numerical approximations taking into account the errors involved in the process.

\item Numerical Approximation: An approximation of the exact solution to the problem with the
use of known numerical techniques while minimizing error.

\item Recursion: The repeated application of a procedure or program. \wss{I
    think you can find a better definition of recursion.  With this definition a
    for loop is recursion.  :-)}

\item Initial Value Problem: A type of ODE problem where the initial conditions are stated and
used to find the solution to the ODE.

\item Linear Function: A function which graph is a straight line. \wss{A
    definition for linear ODEs would be more appropriate.}

\item Continuous Function: A function which does not have any breaks in its graph across its domain.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data Definitions} \label{sec_datadef}

This section collects and defines all the data needed to build the instance
models. The dimension of each quantity is also given.

and $x_\text{k}$, return $y_\text{k}$ such that $y(x_\text{k}) = y_\text{k}$ (the final

                assumption that you are only accepting the explicit form.  Does
                that mean that you are also considering the implicit form?}  The above model gives the definition of an ordinary differential equation initial
                value problem.

                A differential equation is an equation, where the unknown is a
                function and both the function and its derivatives (rate of change) appear in the
                equation.

                An ordinary differential equation is a differential equation involving only ordinary derivatives with respect to a single independent variable.

                For an arbitrary ODE, the true solution will, in general, be unknown.

                Using the given initial values, numerical methods are used to find numerical approximations of the solution to the ODE.

\subsubsection*{Detailed derivation of Euler's Method}

Let $y' = f(x, y),$   $y(x_0) = y_0$, $h$ as a fixed positive number
(step-size), and consider the equally spaced points in the domain:\\
\\
\hspace*{2ex} $x_n = x_0 + nh,$   $n = 0, 1, 2...$\\
\\
The construction of values $y_n$ that approximate the solution values proceeds as follows.
At the point $(x_0, y_0)$, the slope of the solution to $y' = f(x, y)$ is given by
${dy}/{dx} = f(x_0, y_0)$. Hence the tangent line to the solution curve at the initial point is:\\
\\
\hspace*{2ex} $y = y_0 + (x - x_0)*f(x_0, y_0)$.\\
\\
Using this tangent line to approximate the next point in the solution set, we find that
for the point $x_1 = x_0 + h$, we can assume the following approximation:\\
\\

\wss{To make it clear that you have a family of methods, I would introduce an
  instance model for one-step initial value problem solvers.  The equation would
  be $${y}_{k+1} = {y}_k + h \phi(t_k, {x}_k, h_k)$$ The only difference for
  your family members is how $\phi$ is defined.  This approach would let you
  easily add new family members in the specification, simply by giving new
  values for $\phi$.  You have also (implicitly as far as I can tell) assumed
  that all $h_k$ are equal to $h$.}

\subsubsection*{Derivation of the Fourth Order Runge Kutta's Method}

Runge Kutta Methods can be derived by approximating the solution to the integral using quadrature rules:\\
\\
\hspace*{2ex}$$y_{n+1} - y_n = \int_{x_n}^{x_{n+1}} f(x, y(x)) dx$$\\
\\
Starting from the Taylor series representation of an ODE:
\\
\hspace*{2ex}$$y_{n+1} = y_n + h*F(x_n, y_n; h)$$
where the choice of F depends on the order of method.
\\
The exhaustive derivation of the the Runge Kutta method can be analyzed in~\cite{Nagle2000}.

% This section simplifies the problem by stating the assumptions.
% The numbers given in the square brackets refer to the theoretical model
% [T], general definition [GD], data definition [DD], instance model [IM], or
% likely change [LC], in which the respective assumption is used.

\begin{itemize}

  % \wss{Short description of each assumption.  Each assumption
  %   should have a meaningful label.  Use cross-references to identify the
  %   appropriate traceability to T, GD, DD etc., using commands like dref, ddref etc.}

\item[A\refstepcounter{assumpnum}\theassumpnum \label{A_programcalls}:]
It is assumed that the user will declare which of the four methods (Euler's Method, Heun's

on compile time as the intent is to keep the library lightweight and functional - only four
classical models were considered.]}

\wss{The idea of rationales here is nice.} 

\item[A\refstepcounter{assumpnum}\theassumpnum \label{A_typeoff}:]

languages.]}

\wss{This rationale doesn't really hold up to scrutiny.  A system of first order

\section{Traceability Matrices and Graphs}

The purpose of the traceability matrices is to provide easy references on what has to be additionally
modified if a certain component is changed.  Every time a 
component is changed, the items in the column or row of that component that are 
marked with an ``X'' should be modified as well.  Table~\ref{Table:A_trace}
shows the dependencies of goals, theoretical models, data
definitions, instance models, and calculations with the assumptions, calculations, and outputs.
